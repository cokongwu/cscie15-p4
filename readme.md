## Description
For this project, I tried to make something that might be useful to me in real life in order to get a feel for the development process. I created a buddy travel planner. The idea is to create a web app that allows users to log in, and create polls to decide on their group travel destinations. They can create, edit, and remove travel destinations that they are interested in. They can then create trips with start and end dates based off those destinations. Ultimately, the trips can be placed into polls and voted on by the group of users. This project is intended to be a first working demo of on-going project.

## Demo
The demo link is here: http://screencast.com/t/RipoThAkWqa . It seemed that I may have over-reached with my project and that I am not able to add the features that I intended. The point of putting airport codes was to automate the process of finding cheapest flights in order to help with the voting process. I also need to do more to with the user groups in order to allow different subgroups of users to be use the app without interfering with each others destinations, trips, and polls. 


## Outside Sources
I used a couple packages that were recommended to us in class, laravel/laravel, paste/pre, and barryvdh/laravel-debugbar. I also used the api from http://jqueryui.com/datepicker/ to handle date inputs for the trips. I had trouble finding APIs to use with airport code look-ups and flight price look-ups.
